Chemical Inventory Lite is a lightweight web application designed to help manage chemical inventories efficiently. [See the demo](https://chemical-inventory-lite.netlify.app/).

### Data Storage
In this "Lite" version, chemical data is simply stored in `./temp/data.json`. In a future iteration, a proper database system will be introduced. For now this makes installation easy!
